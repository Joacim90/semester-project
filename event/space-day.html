            Get ready to launch into a universe of discovery at Space Day, a
            full-day celebration of all things outer space! Specially designed
            for kids aged 7 to 15, this event invites young explorers and their
            families to uncover the wonders of our solar system and beyond
            through interactive exhibits, hands-on experiments, and
            out-of-this-world fun. Whether your child dreams of becoming an

            the stars—Space Day will ignite their imagination and fuel a
            lifelong love for science.
